# Code as Creative Media

## Questions

* How many have coded before?
* How many work with computers in their primary creative capacity

* Overlearning one's instruments often leads to misrepresenting/polluting one's messages
* Naive cuts and schopenhauer

* Creativity of execution versus the creativity of vision
* Drafting (prototyping) and editing (iterating)

1. Do anything badly -> try a lot of things
2. What do you do well -> gotta choose and commit
   - choose the hardest thing you think you can do


* Working with the esoteric "creative spirit" within oneself
  * Adversarial methods -> ok/vital for short term, bad if habitual or long-term
    * "Just do it"/brute force
    * Feeding demons (envy, greed)
    * Willful adoption of fallacies ("people jog every day, and I hate jogging way more than coding", all-in, sunk costs)
  * Games ("longest streak")
    * "longest streak"
    * "how would x do it"/"done in the style of x"
    * and other oblique strategies
  * Leave it and come back later -> at least recharges energy if not providing some insights or epiphanies. when you're calling the shots and deadlines, it's more important to keep confidence up and energy going than finish a particular task
    * Lateral work
    * Decompression
      * Pay mind to free energy sources: Nature and home cooking
      * Really really decompress, don't stay wound up waiting
    * Be honest with yourself

* Still do a lot of stuff to stay balanced
  * Code and audio collaboration with Homemake
  * Ceramics
  * Limited photography
