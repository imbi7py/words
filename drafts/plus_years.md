# Plus Years

If there is one thing I have learned about programmers, it is that
they are at their most productive when they are working at the very
edge of their competency. In theory, if we all just wrote what we
knew, we'd be solving long-standing problems left and right. But it's
the bends and turns in the path that keep us engaged. This is why
every creative programmer has this personal border; software engineers
with 5-10 years of experience are toying with hardware: Arduinos, and
3D printers. Digital engineers playing with analog. There is no
objective bottom or final frontier, but it's something just beyond our
grasp that's earned our respect.

If you're building a team to build something innovative fast, think
twice when holding out for engineers with 5+ years experience doing
exactly what you need. Maybe you need someone who barely knows what
they are doing and can't wait to see what the next twist will be.
