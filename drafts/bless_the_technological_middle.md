  * Dank and shadowy corners where filters are as absent as decency, like the chans

Subscribe to a local listserv. Donate to your private torrent
indexes. Let your neighborhood forum operator know you appreciate
their humble yet honest Internet establishment. They're the ones
keeping the true spirit of the web alive.
