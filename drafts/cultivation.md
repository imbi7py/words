* Seems like every software company communicates how very lucky they
  are to get "top talent". And while primarily patronizing, this is
  unfortunately exactly the case. Companies of all sizes can be found
  spending exorbitant amounts of money on recruiters and recruiting
  setups to effectively trawl the ecosystem for ideal people.

* Within software, this "job gap" or "talent gap" is being created and
  worsened by foregoing almost all the skill cultivation opportunities
  pursued by more mature industries, like hardware

* This is not true of all technology companies. Biotech and hardware
  have very different atmospheres.
