# Hot Take - Mad Max: Fury Road

* Overall pretty enjoyable. Continues the Mad Max series trend of
  becoming progressively easier to pick apart at a logistics level
  (water/fuel/food management, labor division, etc.)

* Weird film speed tricks felt a bit last century at times, but
  production was pretty top notch (even a notch above most headlining
  movies these days). The action was of a nerve-wracking sort, not
  really righteous, definitely not clean. But it's a grotesque movie
  about a grotesque world, so it plays. Also note that it feels like
  85% of the movie is part of the same action sequence, which is kind
  of unique.

* I have no idea where some people get off singling out any feministic
  undertones in the film. There are some strong women that play into
  the story and their roles were nowhere near the least
  plausible. Their roles in the film may have been feminist in nature,
  but given many other aspects of the film, it's pretty hard to say
  that the film was a feminist one, unfortunately.

That said, the film still came across as glaringly problematic. One
thing that may come as a surprise or spoiler: Max is such a strong and
silent type that he comes across as basically an observer to the
envents of the film. Almost all the dialogue and focus goes to the
brutes that capture him right at the start of the film. Not long after
that, I get the distinct sense I'm watching a strong sort of white
power trip. Now, I understand caricature and maybe even the role it
can play in criticizing brutish aspects of human nature, and I'm not
talking about the shaved heads and tattoos. But it really did feel
like a carefully concocted fantasy meant to indulge the worst aspects
of American culture. Anoter film similar in this regard, Team America:
World Police, was more obviously satirical and critical, yet its
message was also well-received. Those appreciating the satire found it
satisfyingly biting, but there were many whose main takeaway seemed to
be American superiority. Thankfully Mad Max was white on both sides,
but there is still something about reinforcing the idea that there is
a savage, yet awesomely indomitable, Valhalla-bound warrior in the
heart of the common white man. And he drives a monster truck with
flamethrowers.
