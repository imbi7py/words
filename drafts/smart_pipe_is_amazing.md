# "SmartPipe": No pipe smarter

If you haven't seen it yet, you need to see SmartPipe, one of a series
of "Infomercials" Adult Swim recently released online (and also
probably on Cartoon Network). After watching it twice in a row, I can
say without a doubt: every 60 seconds of this 11-minute masterpiece is
worth a full episode of Mike Judge's Silicon Valley. Satire
does not get any sharper or better. [Watch it
now][smart_pipe].

I'm not sure I've ever seen a satire so on-point and personally
relevant. It was immediately familiar and absurd, getting more and
more accurate to the point of overflowing to grim reminder.

What really sells it is that SmartPipe is actually a very plausible
idea, a piece of "home infrastructure" (e.g., Nest) that builds on the
"quantified self" (e.g., Fitbit) and "personal biotech" (e.g.,
23andMe), plus all the social and mobile fixings. Really it's just an
invasive toilet system built for rich people, if anyone.

But the video is much more than just an infomercial about the product,
instead presenting a company in an all too realistic scenario. Plagued
by government intervention and legal strife, the company appeals to
viewers to "actively harrass" officials into letting the market of
markets share your anus. And it is so very convincing. Sascha, your
guide in the wild world of SmartPipe, is so immediately familiar an
archetype that his words sink right into the newtech-primed
psyche. Every character, from proud product designer to passionate
community manager to the market-obsessed CEO, perfectly portrayed by
Mark Proksch, paint so photorealistic a picture of startups and
Silicon Valley that I find myself wanting to hear what advice VCs and
angels have for SmartPipe, as well as what advice they have for
themselves now that the media's got the startup game so pegged.
