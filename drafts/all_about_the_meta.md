# The Meat vs The Meta

In the beginning, hardware was a limiting factor. Memory and CPU
cycles, silicon real estate, defined the possibility space.

But more recently, software is the limiting factor. Hardware is cheap,
resources are plentiful, but software to take advantage of those
resources is scarce. This is largely because software capable of
utilizing those resources is often exponentially, fractally
complex. Especially when considering the twin anchors of legacy
systems and users.

Still, the surplus of hardware resources, freedom from The Meat, has
opened a bright new passage, The Meta. Total permeation of
self-describing applications and runtimes hold the only key to
transcending as a computing civilization.

(To make the metaphor explicit, consider the societies of old (and too
many still), where food, water, territory, etc. were virtually all one
could hope to secure. Now, for many, those are a given, and those
people are in a position to move on to higher Maslowian
needs. Amusement, philosophy, and the fun intersection that is
introspection.

Sidenote: The Old generated its own philosophers in both cases,
Socrates and Richard Gabriel no doubt shared a lament.)
