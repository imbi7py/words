# Listen to Wikipedia App Announcement

A couple of months ago, we partnered with friend of Hatnote, [Bryan
Oltman][bryan], to finally build our most-requested feature: [an iOS mobile app
version of Listen to Wikipedia][ituneslink]. Today, we're proud to announce that it's ready!

(screenshot + link)

It has all the [Listen to Wikipedia][l2w] features you know and love,
and a few others specifically designed for mobile. It also has support
for all 30+ languages! The app's specially designed for iOS 7, but
we've tested it on a variety of versions. If you encounter any issues,
[definitely get in touch with Bryan][bryan].

It's been a busy few months for Hatnote, both on and off the wiki
court. Still, hopefully this week (or maybe even just this post) will
make it all worthwhile. Go grab the app now, and, if you've got a moment,
do us a favor and help others discover Wikipedia by submitting a
well-deserved review on iTunes.

PS If you're an Android developer and would like to develop a similar
app, definitely get in touch.
