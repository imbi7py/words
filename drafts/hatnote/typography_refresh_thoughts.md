# Wikipedia Typography Refresh

## The Background

Last week, Wikipedia [launched a typography
refresh][refreshpost]. This is a big deal for a variety of reasons,
especially given that Wikipedia may well be the most content-focused
mainstream website out right now. No ads, no likes, reblogs, or
comments; Wikipedia is a no-nonsense functional site that serves its
purpose well.

## The Change

The change was subtle, but noticeable, like a good typography change
should be. Mainly, headings were now serif, and the body remained a
sans-serif. The contrast between the headings and body are used to
inject subtle visual interest. This is a widely-recognized typographic
technique, and it's not hard to find examples of it in print and web
journalism, from blogs to mainstream news outlets.

## The Rub

Wikipedia not only puts content front and center, but it also gives
content creators unparalleled control over the look of the page. In
fact, it's surprising how well most pages have maintained their
internal stylistic consistency. Up until the change, text was kept
simple and neutral, embodying the core values of Wikipedia
itself. More importantly, when a page required special visual elements
in the shape of an infobox or a timeline, the neutral styling let that
visual element tell its story.

version of the the thrice-repeated title doesn't belong?"

The old style was the spiritual peer of Helvetica, with [no intrinsic
statement or meaning of its own][helvetica]. On many pages, the new
style's added visual contrast creates a clash between default styles
and unpredictable user-created content.

## The (In)Conclusion

[Jared Zimmerman][jared], Wikimedia's Director of User Experience, said that
this effort is far from done. I think this is an excellent way to
approach the challenge. It's hard enough designing one page at a time,
let alone the millions of articles and pages spread across hundreds of
wikis. Congratulations and kudos for getting this first iteration out
the door so quickly.

The goal of making the typographic experience more consistent is a
very worthy one, just please make sure the consistency is aligned with
the content, and not just the platform.

## The Footnote

What the current design lacks in explicit design was at least
partially made up by evolution. Iterative design is an attempt at
faster-than-evolution progress, and should thus be conducted with
care and respect for evolution's pragmatic results.
