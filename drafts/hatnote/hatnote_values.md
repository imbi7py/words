# Some Hatnote principles

Everyone on the whole Internet uses Wikipedia. Facebook users, Tumblr
users, LinkedIn users, RSS users, everyone. There are all these
different interaction patterns that people have come to expect from
sites the frequent.

Wikipedia as a product/company is very very lean, very small. <200
people. As a result they can't experiment with as much of industry
practices, etc. It's up to the community to help fill in these gaps
and fulfill their own needs. This seems straightforward and good, But,
no other sites that people frequent really do that, either, so not
many people step up to do this. Wikipedia is special in certain
primary ways, and this is a side effect.

So Hatnote exists to try and fill these gaps, providing alternative
ways of using and experiencing Wikipedia. Visualizations and emails.
