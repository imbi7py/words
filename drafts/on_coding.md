# On coding

Once I tried programming ever day for 438 days. The basis was simple:
If others can do activities I find difficult (e.g., recreational
running) on a daily routine, I should be able to do recreational
activities I enjoy (e.g., open-source development) daily as well.

Overall this was a good experience and I'm glad for it. However, I'm
not sure I'd recommend it broadly. It changes the way you look at code
and in retrospect it's not hard to see why. It takes a fundamentally
creative task and turns it into a performance task. Whether athletic
or aesthetic, professional or recreational, performance is primarily
about reproduction.

Some might say, "But performers are also creative! They create
interpretations of their task." This is true, but ask a musician to
perform a distinct or wholly original interpretation night after night
and, if they don't scoff, they too will soon be tapped.

With proper abstractions and discipline, there should be very little
rote about code. It's not a run around the neighborhood. It's rarely
even just a new neighborhood. It's unincorporated, unblazed domains,
and traversal may require the use of some undiscovered legs.
