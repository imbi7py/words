# Thoughts on New York City

Just returning from my first visit. Didn't have an agenda other than
seen old friends and get a sense for what life would be like in the
city.

Technology is just one of many industries in the city, and not really
one of the limelit ones at that. Behind finance, fashion, and food,
technology seems to pick itself apart less, compared to the bay. The
technologists I know in the bay are divided into cloisters, whereas
New Yorker take their particulars less seriously. It's personal
preference as to whether this is good or bad, but it certainly has
social implications.

The benefit of workable public transit is certainly immense. The
density and diversity of many neighborhoods appreciated. Quality
abounds in food, atmosphere, and traditional culture. Graffiti and
other textural elements are such that they feel lived-in, not remote
or neglected.

The celebrity status of the landmarks probably wears off quickly for
most of the worldly. Central Park is really just a park. Several warm
moments with other people, but a notable absence of laidbackness or
ease. There are few indications of understanding or acceptance of new
aesthetics or media, in both mainstream and alt channels
(MoMA/Brooklyn). Similarly, there was less impressive architecture
than expected, given the level of construction work witnessed,
combined with the cultural status.

Takeaways:

  * It's easier to meet people in New York than in SF. There is
    noticeably more trust and less fear between arbitrary people on
    the street, if not more patience.

  * It's very easy to find engaging activities for many different
    types of people, provided one is comfortable living in dense
    areas.

  * Among New Yorkers, there is only marginally less insecurity about
    choice of resident city, as compared to SF and LA. This seems to
    reinforce that locational pride can't fill holes left in
    individual life. The regional identity race is too ubiquitous a
    subtext for its counterproductivity.

  * Food: Dollar slices are neat, but Japantown sushi all day. PBR
    tastes fine. Panna cotta is hard to find in Little Italy because
    few operators seemed to be Italian? I'm not sure I believe my
    friends than NYC brunch is a bigger deal than SF brunch, but it's
    a frivolous and moot argument. Later hours very appreciated across
    the board. Among the reasonably-priced sushi, 4+ star sushi in New
    York gets maybe a 3 in SJ. That's strange because I've seen the
    sourcing sheets for my favorite sushi place and a good chunk of
    the stuff comes from the Atlantic.

  * NYC felt safer than SF overall. Fewer unhinged people. I did not
    witness a single shocking event in NYC, whereas I often see them
    more than daily in SF. Both SF and NYC have adjacent Little Italy
    and Chinatown neighborhoods. The brand-new Queens night market
    seemed comparable to, but smaller and less noteworthy affair than
    SJ Japantown's Obon festival, which I'd never found impressive,
    but maybe I should revise that assessment. NYC is not very
    bike-friendly, both in terms of street safety and theft. Never saw
    so many bike skeletons chained to signs, etc. In SF someone would
    at least pick them up for the scrap.

  * Atmospherically, I'd probably prefer New York in the spring and
    fall, but SF in the summer and winter. SF probably smells worse on
    average, but I believe my friends about NYC in the summer. It
    would be nice to travel around to all the nearby places with the
    various well-developed railways.

  * If one really had no other indicator or guidance of where one
    should go, I'd probably say NYC is a very versatile spot. The
    living skills acquired there likely stack well and pay long-term
    dividends. Still, I would be more concerned about the whole lack
    of guidance aspect. In terms of industries that benefit strongly
    from presence in the hub, NYC has more than any American city I've
    visited. But it's far from a monopoly. There are many ways to live
    a good life, and an infinitesimal proportion of them are in New
    York. Only sustain that perceived pinnacle as long as it is and
    effective motivator.
