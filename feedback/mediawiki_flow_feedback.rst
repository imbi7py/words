MediaWiki Flow-style Talk page feedback
=======================================

Glad Talk pages are getting the attention they deserve

Hey all, just wanted to drop a note and say that I appreciate the everyone's focus and hard work on Talk pages. Here are some initial impressions:

* Specifically about my first experience, I wasn't sure whether to start a new topic or leave a reply. There isn't a search, there's no table of contents, there's no pagination, and everything is really spread out, so even as I type this I'm worried this comment won't get seen.
* As mentioned above, things seem very loose and space-inefficient on my 1600x900 laptop. There's just too much whitespace. I only see maybe 4 comments per screen.
* Whether scrolling through or reading individual comments, the type hierarchy really isn't working for me. There are too many levels, too closely spaced on the emphasis gradient. There's enough variation to make it appear diverse (busy, even), but not enough to make things distinctive.
* Having my username default-included in every thread as a call-to-action is ok, but it doesn't need a whole padded row of vertical space.
* It's possible to create a topic with no title, that's no good.
* I'd like to see some high-level stuff like total counts of topics/comments at the top of the page.
* Another concern I've got is that this new talk page structure precludes more structured discussion patterns. For instance, I've seen wikis adopt conventions like top-level sections for "Page structure", "Factual accuracy", and other more general talk topics. In other words, not every page/wiki has a convention of every topic getting its own dedicated H2.
* How do you clean out talk pages? Deletion and archiving are critical, and can't just be left to automatic burying. Will Talk pages still have a wiki-editable area? Even forums have sticky topics, and that's a compromise they had to make, frankly. Talk pages can do better than phpBB.
* Minor thing, the multilingual keyboard widget causes my text box bottom border to oscillate by a couple pixels on every keystroke. Otherwise I think that feature is pretty cool.

All in all, I think this is a good start. The autosigning is very important. The threading is super important. The codification of these idioms is going to be huge for Wikipedia/Mediawiki, and I'm really looking forward to future developments!
